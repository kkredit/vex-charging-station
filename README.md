Software controlling an automatic Vex battery charging station

2017/1/31
Repo creation. The purpose of this project is to control a VEX robotics battery charging station. Learn more about VEX at http://www.vexrobotics.com/. Learn more about the batteries at http://www.vexrobotics.com/batteries-and-chargers.html.
The design uses an Arduino Nano to connect and disconnect the battery from the charger, to read the battery voltage, and to control an LED and LCD display.
