Software controlling an automatic Vex battery charging station

2017/1/31
Repo creation. The purpose of this project is to control a VEX robotics battery charging station. Learn more about VEX at http://www.vexrobotics.com/. Learn more about the batteries at http://www.vexrobotics.com/batteries-and-chargers.html.
The design uses an Arduino Nano to connect and disconnect the battery from the charger, to read the battery voltage, and to control an LED and LCD display.

The ability to connect and disconnect the battery from the charger has been intentionally removed so as not to interfere with the "smarts" of the official Vex Smart Charger, which does the same thing. The ability to measure current draw has been added.
